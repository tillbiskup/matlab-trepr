%
% Each file format that is recognized by the trEPRload function
% has its own entry in this file. The format of this entry is as follows:
%
% [<file format>]
% type = <ascii|binary>
% identifierString = <string that can be used to identify the file>
% function = <function that is used to handle the file>
% parameters = <additional parameters passed to the function>

[ascii_save_2Dspectrum]
type = ascii
identifierString = ascii_save_2Dspectrum
function = trEPR_read
% should be replaced by a function reading all these ascii files
% previously written by the trEPR toolbox

[fsc2]
type = ascii
identifierString = fsc2
function = trEPRfsc2Load

[iniFileWrite]
type = ascii
identifierString = iniFileWrite
function = iniFileRead

[metaGen]
type = ascii
identifierString = metaGen
function = metaGenFileRead
% should be replaced by a call to a more general function
% because metaGenFileRead and iniFileRead are nearly identical
