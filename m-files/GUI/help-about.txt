This toolbox and especially the GUI
would not have been possible without many persons
who contributed in some or the other way.


A very special thanks for many things goes to:

Stefan Weber
&
Erik Schleicher


Several persons - besides the two mentioned above -
contributed ideas, helped with tips&tricks, ...

Martin Hussels

Thomas Berthold


I apologize for the incompleteness of this list.
If someone thinks that he or she should be added,
please drop me a note.


Besides that, I learned a great deal from other people
that did and do a lot more work with MATLAB.

Parts of the code are based heavily on code written by
other people. Where this is the case, I tried to mention
it directly in the respective files.

Nevertheless, to mention the most important
sources of inspiration:
