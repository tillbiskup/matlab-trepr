% Each format has a block in the file, starting with the block name in
% brackets.
%
% NOTE: Block names need to start with an alphabetic character (no number)
% and cannot contain special characters or spaces. That is due to being
% used as field names for a MATLAB(r) struct structure.
%
% Following the description of all necessary parameters from the MATLAB(r)
% documentation:
%
% PaperPosition - four-element rect vector
%
% Location on printed page. A rectangle that determines the location of the
% figure on the printed page.
% Specify this rectangle with a vector of the form:
%
%   rect = [left, bottom, width, height]
%
% where left specifies the distance from the left side of the paper to the
% left side of the rectangle and bottom specifies the distance from the
% bottom of the page to the bottom of the rectangle.
% Together these distances define the lower-left corner of the rectangle.
% width and height define the dimensions of the rectangle.
% The PaperUnits property specifies the units used to define this rectangle.
%
% 
% PaperPositionMode - auto | {manual}
%
% WYSIWYG printing of figure.
%
% manual - MATLAB honors the value specified by the PaperPosition property.
%
% auto   - MATLAB prints the figure the same size as it appears on the
%          computer screen, centered on the page.
%
% 
% PaperSize - [width height]
%
% Paper size. Size of the current PaperType, measured in PaperUnits.
% See PaperType to select standard paper sizes.
%
%
% PaperType
%  
% Selection of standard paper size. 
% Sets the PaperSize to one of the following standard sizes.
% Note that you might need to change the PaperPosition property in order to
% position the printed figure on the new paper size.
% One solution is to use normalized PaperUnits, which enables MATLAB to
% automatically size the figure to occupy the same relative amount of the
% printed page, regardless of the paper size. 
%
%
% PaperUnits - normalized | {inches} | centimeters | points
%
% Hardcopy measurement units.
% Specifies the units used to define the PaperPosition and PaperSize
% properties. MATLAB measures all units from the lower-left corner of the
% page. normalized units map the lower-left corner of the page to (0, 0)
% and the upper-right corner to (1.0, 1.0).
% inches, centimeters, and points are absolute units
% (one point equals 1/72 of an inch).
%
% If you change the value of PaperUnits, it is good practice to return the
% property to its default value after completing your computation so as not
% to affect other functions that assume PaperUnits is set to the default
% value.
%
%
% Besides the parameters documented above, you can specify font name and
% font size as well. Font sizes are given in points (pt) as usual.
