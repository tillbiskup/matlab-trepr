%
% Each file format that is recognized by the trEPRload function
% has its own entry in this file. The format of this entry is as follows:
%
% [<file format>]
% type = <ascii|binary>
% identifierString = <string that can be used to identify the file>
% function = <function that is used to handle the file>
% parameters = <additional parameters passed to the function>
% combineMultiple = <true|false> whether routine can combine multiple files
%
% In case of binary file formats, "identifierString" is the extension 
% (with leading dot).

[ascii_save_timeslice]

function = trEPRasciiLoad

% Format used in Berlin for a set of transient data.
% Each fsc2 file is loaded by the function trEPRfsc2Load, but additional
% parameters from the metafile are added to the datasets.
[fsc2Meta]
type = ascii
identifierString = metadata fsc2 program trEPR
function = trEPRfsc2MetaLoad

% Format used in Berlin for transient data. fsc2 files are generally simple
% ascii data files with different header depending on the actual script
% used to measure. Here, the program is included in the header of the file
% together with a bunch of the most important parameters.

[metaGen]
type = ascii
identifierString = metaGen
function = metaGenFileRead
% should be replaced by a call to a more general function
% because metaGenFileRead and iniFileRead are nearly identical

% Format used in Freiburg for transient data. Compatible to gnuplot
% with special headers derived from the speksim format (see there).
% Every time slice is saved to a single file together with a time axis.
%
% IMPORTANT: gnuplot has to be defined before speksim due to the
%            nearly identical identifier string.
[gnuplot]
type = ascii
identifierString = # Source : transient
function = trEPRgnuplotLoad
combineMultiple = true

% Format used in Freiburg for transient data. Directly written by the
% transient spectrometer. Every time slice is saved to a single file.
%
% IMPORTANT: speksim has to be defined after gnuplot due to the
%            nearly identical identifier string.
