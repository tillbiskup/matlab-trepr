% Configuration file for the trEPRload function of the trEPR toolbox

% (c) 2010-2011, Till Biskup <till@till-biskup.de>
%
% Each file format that is recognized by the trEPRload function
% has its own entry in this file. The format of this entry is as follows:
%
% [<file format>]
% type = <ascii|binary>
% identifierString = <string that can be used to identify the file>
% function = <function that is used to handle the file>
% parameters = <additional parameters passed to the function>
% combineMultiple = <true|false> whether routine can combine multiple files
%
% In case of binary file formats, "identifierString" is the extension 
% (with leading dot).

[ascii_save_2Dspectrum]
type = ascii
identifierString = ascii_save_2Dspectrum
function = trEPRasciiLoad

[ascii_save_spectrum]
type = ascii
identifierString = ascii_save_spectrum
function = trEPRasciiLoad

[ascii_save_timeslice]
type = ascii
identifierString = ascii_save_timeslice
function = trEPRasciiLoad

% Format used in Berlin for transient data. fsc2 files are generally simple
% ascii data files with different header depending on the actual script
% used to measure. Here, the program is included in the header of the file
% together with a bunch of the most important parameters.
[fsc2]
type = ascii
identifierString = fsc2
function = trEPRfsc2Load

[iniFileWrite]
type = ascii
identifierString = iniFileWrite
function = iniFileRead

[metaGen]
type = ascii
identifierString = metaGen
function = metaGenFileRead
% should be replaced by a call to a more general function
% because metaGenFileRead and iniFileRead are nearly identical

% Format used in Freiburg for transient data. Compatible to gnuplot
% with special headers derived from the speksim format (see there).
% Every time slice is saved to a single file together with a time axis.
%
% IMPORTANT: gnuplot has to be defined before speksim due to the
%            nearly identical identifier string.
[gnuplot]
type = ascii
identifierString = # Source : transient
function = trEPRgnuplotLoad
combineMultiple = true

% Format used in Freiburg for transient data. Directly written by the
% transient spectrometer. Every time slice is saved to a single file.
%
% IMPORTANT: speksim has to be defined after gnuplot due to the
%            nearly identical identifier string.
[speksim]
type = ascii
identifierString = Source : transient
function = trEPRspeksimLoad
combineMultiple = true

% Format Bruker Xepr writes when exporting TREPR datasets to ASCII
[BrukerTREPRASCII]
type = ascii

function = trEPRbrukerASCIIload

% Unzipped version of the format used from the new versions of the 
% trEPR toolbox to save the data.
[xml]

function = xmlRead

% Format used from the new versions of the trEPR toolbox to save the data.
%
% It is basically a XML file that was zipped to save disk space.
[xmlzip]
