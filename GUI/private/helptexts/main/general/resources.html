		<h1>Where to find other help resources?</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			A few ideas where to get more help.
		</p>
		<h2>Website</h2>
		<p>
			Probably the best and most up-to-date source of information about the trEPR toolbox and this GUI is its website:
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="matlab:web('http://www.till-biskup.de/en/software/matlab/trepr/','-browser')">http://www.till-biskup.de/en/software/matlab/trepr/</a>
		</p>
		<h2>Supervisor</h2>
		<p>
			Another invaluable source of information, not only regarding information about the trEPR toolbox and GUI, is normally your supervisor (if you have one).
		</p>
		<h2>Manual</h2>
		<p>
			Once the manual gets written, there should be some more detailed introduction to the toolbox and the GUI available there, access it via the MATLAB&trade; help browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			Until then, perhaps the best source of information and help is this online help available within the toolbox and the GUI. Besides that, most of the command-line functions come with rather extensive in-built help that can be accessed by either the <tt>help</tt> or <tt>doc</tt> command from the Matlab&trade; command line.
		</p>
		<h2>Last option: toolbox author</h2>
		<p>
			If all the above listed sources of information don't help, you may write an email to the toolbox author. Contact details can be found either on its website (see above) or in the <a href="matlab:trEPRgui_aboutwindow();">About</a> window.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Please note:</strong> Do not contact the author of this toolbox with toolbox-related questions <em>before</em> having consulted the other sources of information, namely the toolbox homepage (Website) and its FAQ section.
		</p>
		<h2>Bug report</h2>
		<p>
			If you encounter a bug (or think that you have found one), please don't hesitate to file a bug report. Details how to do that can be found <a href="../internal/bugreport.html">at the respective help page</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Please note:</strong> Check first with the website whether this bug has been already reported. If in doubt, do report the bug. It's better to have the same bug reported twice than unnoticed and therefore not fixed.
