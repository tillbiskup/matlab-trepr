        <title>trEPR GUI : Main window : Welcome</title>
    </head>
    <body>
		<h1>Welcome to the trEPR toolbox GUI.</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			New here? Or interested in a more consistent introduction in the concepts of the trEPR toolbox and mainly its GUI? This is the place to start...
		</p>
		<div class="hurry">
		<h2>If in a hurry</h2>
		<p>
			Suppose you don't want to read long introductions, but just start processing your data recorded right now: Read the section <a href="shortintro.html">"GUI in 2 minutes"</a>. Besides that, please note that each panel and each additional GUI window comes with its own in-built help.
		</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			All those with more time and interest in a slightly more detailed introduction, keep reading.
		</p>
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			What you have in hands is the result of now about eight years of more or less constant development. It all started out in 2005 with the need of having a set of scripts to process trEPR spectra. First being Matlab scripts, later functions, at some point the need for an easy-to-use graphical interface appeared...
		</p>
		<p>
			The question <a href="whygui.html">why a GUI</a> was introduced is covered in a separate section. The good news for all those more interested in the command line: All functionality can still be accessed via the command line, and in addition, starting with version 0.3.19 in early 2013, a command line (CMD) found its way into the GUI, laying out the path for a complete scripting of the GUI.
		</p>
		<h2>Key concepts</h2>
		<p>
			The key aspects of developing the GUI (and completely redesigning the toolbox) can be summed up with three keywords:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Modularity</li>
			<li>Robustness</li>
			<li>Usability</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Besides that, there are a few more aspects worth to be mentioned explicitly, particularly as they are not as obvious, but thought to be at least as important if it comes to processing and handling of scientific data:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Metadata</li>
			<li>History of processing</li>
			<li>Documentation</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			These aspects are described in more detail on the <a href="keyconcepts.html">key concepts</a> page. The idea behind is to provide the user with a complete workflow for processing, analysing and displaying/representing the trEPR data recorded, while keeping a complete record and overview of every single step. Much of that is still work in progress, whereas the toolbox is since years in use in a productive (scientific) environment.
		</p>
		<h2>Development</h2>
		<p>
			As mentioned already, the toolbox is under constant development and as of now (May 2013) not available in a "stable" version ready for a productive environment with people not too much interested in debugging software and working around bugs.
		</p>
		<p>
			A up-to-date list of <a href="../internal/newfeatures.html">new features</a> gives an overview of the changes from version to version. There is as well a list of <a href="../internal/knownbugs.html">known bugs</a> and a bit of documentation for <a href="../internal/bugreport.html">how to file a (useful) bug report</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
		<p>
			Although it should be fairly obvious, this software comes with no warranty whatsoever and is provided "as is". The user is solely responsible for any consequences arising out of the use of this toolbox. In terms of scientific data processing and analysis: Although great care has been taken to provide you with a set of functions that perform correct and in scientific means valid operations on the data you process with this software, the author of the software is in no way responsible nor liable for the results. Further details can be found in the <a href="disclaimer.html">disclaimer</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
		<p>
			Last but not least, there is a long list of people to thank for their continuous support, for their encouragement, and for their patience with using the toolbox and reporting (and in parts even fixing) bugs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Instead of listing all those people here, the user is kindly referred to the <a href="matlab:trEPRgui_aboutwindow()">About</a> window of the toolbox. There, they will be displayed if you are patient and wait for a few seconds.
