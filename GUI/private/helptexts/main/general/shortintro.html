		<h1>The trEPR GUI: An introduction in 2 minutes</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			How to use the GUI? A very brief hands-on introduction for the impatient.
		</p>
		<h2>1. Load data</h2>
		<p>
			The first step is to load one or more datasets. That can be done via the "load" panel that is accessed by pressing the <key>Load</key> button on the top right of the main GUI.
		</p>
		<h2>2. Toggle visibility</h2>
		<p>
			After loading one or more datasets from files, you need to make the data appear on the main axis to the left. Therefore, hit the <key>Datasets</key> button that will give you all necessary control.
		</p>
		<h2>3. Sliders</h2>
		<p>
			You can scroll through a 2D dataset in both directions, you can scale the data in both dimensions and you can displace the data in two dimensions. Therefore, press the <key>Slider</key> button that provides you with a convenient display of the current slider values in both data points and actual units of the axes.
		</p>
		<h2>4. Measure</h2>
		<p>
			One of the most natural things to do with a 2D or 1D dataset displayed is to measure distances between different points. This can be done with the "Measure" panel that will appear once you press the <key>Measure</key> button.
		</p>
		<h2>5. Display</h2>
		<p>
			Once you succeeded in displaying the data in a meaningful way, you may want to either export the currently displayed data to a file (MATLAB fig, EPS, PDF, PNG, ...) or to modify the figure as a conventional MATLAB figure.
		</p>
		<p>
			Furthermore, if the data you loaded do not contain the necessary information for the axis labels, you may want to correct or set them as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			Either functionality is easily accessible: Just press the <key>Display</key> button.
		</p>
		<h2>6. Processing</h2>
		<p>
			For the advanced user, the "Processing" panel will provide all sorts of functions for data manipulation, such as accumulating different data sets. 
		</p>
		<h2>7. Analysis</h2>
		<p>
			To finally analyse your data, you might want to fit different functions to them, simulate data or perform deconvolutions. All those functions are grouped within and accessible from the "Analysis" panel.
		</p>
		<h2>8. Internal</h2>
		<p>
			This is a panel you will learn to use later. It covers internals of the GUI, such as setting internal directories or saving/loading snapshots, as well as access to the command line feature (CMD) of the GUI and its history.
		</p>
		<h2>9. Configure</h2>
		<p>
			Just added for completeness in this short description: The "Configure" panel lets you at least partly adjust the behaviour of the trEPR toolbox and especially the GUI to your needs.
