This toolbox and especially the GUI would not have been possible without many people
contributing by some means or other.

A very special thanks for their outstanding support and encouragement, including but by far not restricted to the trEPR toolbox, goes to:

Besides that, I learned a great deal from other people that did and do a lot more work with MATLAB.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Parts of the code are based heavily on code written by other people. Where this is the case, I tried to mention it directly in the respective files.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, to mention the most important sources of inspiration:

Thanks for your patience with all the bugs and the incompleteness of this piece of software.

Clearly, Douglas Adams didn't have GUI programming in mind when writing his fifth volume of the Hitchhiker's Guide trilogy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
But the utter unpredictability of both the user's next step in interacting with a GUI and MATLAB(TM)'s reaction to it comes sometimes close to what Adams describes in "Mostly harmless" in terms of cause and effect.
