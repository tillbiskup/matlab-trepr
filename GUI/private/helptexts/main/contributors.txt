This toolbox and especially the GUI
would not have been possible without many people
contributing by some means or other.


A very special thanks for their outstanding support and encouragement, including but by far not restricted to the trEPR toolbox, goes to:

Stefan Weber
&
Erik Schleicher



Several people - besides the two mentioned above - contributed ideas, helped with tips&tricks, ...



- The former "Berlin crew" -
(where everything originated)


Martin Hussels

Ringo Wenzel
(with his 'cw_ana' toolbox)

Julia Loewenstein

- The Freiburg People -


Bernd Paulus

Thomas Berthold


...and all students debugging the software and encouraging me to continue...

- The Berlin People - 


Henryk Kalbe

I apologise for the incompleteness of this list.
If somebody thinks that he or she should be added, please send me an email.

Besides that, I learned a great deal from other people that did and do a lot more work with MATLAB.

Parts of the code are based heavily on code written by other people. Where this is the case, I tried to mention it directly in the respective files.

Nevertheless, to mention the most important sources of inspiration:


The Matlab(TM) documentation and examples

Thanks for your patience with all the bugs and the incompleteness of this piece of software.

"Anything that happens, happens.
































Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, causes something else to happen.
































Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, happens again.
































It doesn't necessarily do it in chronological order, though."





(D. Adams: "Mostly Harmless")
































Clearly, Douglas Adams didn't have GUI programming in mind when writing his fifth volume of the Hitchhiker's Guide trilogy.

But the utter unpredictability of both the user's next step in interacting with a GUI and MATLAB(TM)'s reaction to it comes sometimes close to what Adams describes in "Mostly harmless" in terms of cause and effect.
