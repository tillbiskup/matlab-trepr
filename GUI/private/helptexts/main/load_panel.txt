LOAD DATA

The "Load" panel contains all controls necessary to load datasets to the GUI.

The basic unit of the trEPR GUI is a "dataset", be it 1D or 2D. Normally, one dataset consists of a single measurement, i.e. a 2D measurement of TREPR data (B0 vs. time).


THE CONTROLS

-= Files to load =-

You can select to

* combine multiple files, or to

* load all (readable) files of a directory

Please, be especially careful with "combining multiple files", as it is intended to be used in case that you have datasets consisting of multiple files, normally one file per time trace (as it is the case for the TREPR data in Freiburg).


-= Preprocessing on load =-

Basically, there are two corrections that are applied regularly to TREPR datasets:

* The pretrigger offset compensation (POC), and 

* the background subtraction (BGC)

The pretrigger offset compensation subtracts the average of the pretrigger part of every time trace from the whole time trace and therefore corrects for DC offsets in the data that are frequently encountered.

The background subtraction is an "fsc2 style" basic background correction that takes the first few time traces, averages over those, and subtracts the average from every time trace of the dataset, therefore correcting for the laser-induced background that is visible in off-resonant signal parts. 

Whereas the former can be applied without damage or side effect to every dataset, the same is not necessarily true for the background subtraction.

If in doubt, don't check the boxes and perform the corrections afterwards manually (via the "Processing" panel) while inspecting the data.


-= Axis labels =-

Check this box if you want the GUI to try to determine the axis labels already during load of the datasets.

If labels could not be determined from the dataset, defaults apply. If more than one dataset is loaded at the same time, the last dataset "wins" in terms of axes labels.


-= File type =-

Currently, this popupmenu has only one entry, "Automatic", as the toolbox is capable of detecting the file types automatically and loads the datasets accordingly.

Especially for some new developments in Berlin (still to come) this might be of interest later on, allowing to select a "meta file" to load that in itself triggers the toolbox to read several datasets and at the same time to modify a few of the parameters of the datasets loaded.


-= The "Load" button =-

Finally, pressing the "Load" button opens the file selection dialogue and allows you to select the files/the directory you want to load datasets from.
