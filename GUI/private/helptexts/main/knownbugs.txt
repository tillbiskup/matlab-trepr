A LIST OF KNOWN BUGS

There is a list of bugs and flaws the author of the GUI is aware of but has for some reason or other not fixed yet.


GENERAL

Close without save

You can simply close the GUI window, even if there are modified spectra. So currently it is completely within your responsibility to make sure you have saved everything before closing the GUI.


DATASETS PANEL

"Line style" & "Get info"

These two functions are not implemented yet. But if you want to change the line style of a given dataset, you might manipulate manually its data structure via getappdata/setappdata. Details can be found on the toolbox webpage in the FAQ section.


MEASURE

Not quite sure whether it works absolutely correct in case of zooming or other "strange" axis limits.


DISPLAY

-= page 3/4 =-

Functions are not implemented yet.


PROCESSING

"Baseline" & "Accumulate"

These two functions are not implemented yet. A preview of the "Baseline correction window" can be seen if you type "trEPRgui_BLCwindow" in the MATLAB(TM) command window.


ANALYSIS

No functions yet. Sorry...


HELP

"Manual"

The "Manual" button most probably shows either something completely unrelated or hopelessly outdated. In worst case it crashes.



These are only the well-known bugs and limitations. There are definitely many more. If you encounter a bug, please don't hesitate fo file a bug report. For details see the "Report a bug" help topic (choose from selection menu above).

Thanks for your patience and support.
