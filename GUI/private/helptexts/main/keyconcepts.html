		<h1>Key concepts of the GUI?</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			A very short introduction to the key concepts behind the trEPR toolbox and especially its GUI.
		</p>
		<p>
			The whole GUI was designed to be both modular and robust. Additional emphasis was on usability.
		</p>
		<p>
			The current piece of software is the result of nearly six years of development of trEPR data processing and analysis software and two years of GUI programming using MATLAB(TM).
		</p>
		<p>
			In the following, the probably less obvious aspects of data processing and analysis will be highlighted and key concepts introduced (but not yet fully implemented) with the trEPR GUI/toolbox described.
		</p>
		<h2>Metadata</h2>
		<p>
			A dataset not only consists of a "list" of numbers that represent the actual data, but as well, and not less important, of a list of additional information, including, but not restricted to, the measurement setup used, the typical device parameters, details about the sample, ...
		</p>
		<p>
			Different groups/people developed different stategies to save these important data (throughout "metadata") together with the pure data.
		</p>
		<p>
			The trEPR toolbox and GUI help both to collect all these metadata and to provide the user with a convenient interface to access and modify them.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the GUI save function saves the complete dataset record with its full structure to an XML file (compressed in a ZIP container), it retains the full information provided for a single dataset.
		</p>
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			Closely related to the metadata, the "history" of a dataset, namely the list of operations performed during processing and analysis, is of high importance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Every dataset that gets loaded into the GUI has its own "history" and every function of the GUI that performs an operation on a given dataset creates a record in that history, including the function name, the parameters used, and the date of operation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <a href="matlab:trEPRgui_infowindow()">Info GUI</a> has a "history browser" implemented providing the user with a convenient interface to explore the complete set of operations performed on a given dataset.
		</p>
		<h2>Status window</h2>
		<p>
			To keep track of what the GUI is currently doing, a "status window" has been added (press the <key>F10</key> key or the <key>Status</key> button below the axis of the main GUI). Therein, all operations and some additional information are listed, each with a "time stamp" for convenient assignment.
