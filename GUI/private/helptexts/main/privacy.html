		<h1>Privacy.</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			<strong>Privacy matters.</strong> What follows is some thoughts of privacy and using the toolbox, together with a few suggestions to minimise spreading data.
		</p>
		<h2>Why talking about privacy?</h2>
		<p>
			Again: privacy matters. It is always an advantage to know what data you are submitting to where and why.
		</p>
		<p>
			Generally, using the toolbox in a normal way should not affect your privacy at all, but there are a few ways how you could potentially give a hint that you are using the toolbox - unintentionally.
		</p>
		<p>
			Good news first: No personal data will be collected by the toolbox itself and sent to the toolbox author. And there is no intention whatsoever to change that or to put any effort in trying to personalize those impersonal data that might be collected by the server hosting the toolbox homepage.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nevertheless, you shall know what kind of personal data are collected within the toolbox, which data might be potentially sensitive, and how to avoid any unwanted communication from within the toolbox with the world outside your computer (as much as the toolbox code itself is concerned).
		</p>
		<h2>How could using the toolbox affect your privacy?</h2>
		<p>
			There are very few ways how you could leave your mark in a way others, and especially the toolbox author, would be able to trace. These are the ways known to the toolbox author, to the best of his knowledge:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Submit a bug report.</li>
			<li>Press the &quot;Website&quot; button(s) in the &quot;Help&quot; windows and/or the &quot;About&quot; window.</li>
			<li>Check (automatically) for updates using the <tt>trEPRupdateCheck</tt> function.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Each of them shall be discussed in a bit more detail below.
		</p>
		<h3>Submitting bug reports</h3>
		<p>
			Submitting a bug report, either (preferrable) using the Bug reporting facilities (namely BugZilla at the time of writing) or via email to the toolbox author, necessarily unravels your email address. But that seems pretty unavoidable, as you normally want to get in touch with the toolbox author for good reasons.
		</p>
		<p>
			Quite important for submitting bug reports via BugZilla: Everybody can create an account, therefore <em>never, ever</em> leave any sensible information in the comments or the attachments provided. If you need to provide the toolbox author with some original data or are asked to do so, use some more secure channels of transmission, such as (encrypted) email.
		</p>
		<h3>Using the &quot;Website&quot; buttons</h3>
		<p>
			These buttons are provided solely for your convenience. The website URL of the toolbox can be found either in the help or using the <tt>trEPRinfo</tt> routine. If you press the button, normally your system's preferred browser will open the website, and quite unavoidably this leaves some information (your computer's IP address and your browser details, such as program, version, and operating system) in the log files of the server. Nevertheless, as stated above, these log files will not be analysed for other than statistical measures and for ensuring proper functioning of the server itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			The toolbox website itself doesn't use any tracking software. For those interested in details: It relies (as of the time of writing) on a dokuwiki instance, JavaScript is only needed for displaying the indexmenu (the navigation tree) in a more convenient manner.
		</p>
		<h3>Automatic check for updates.</h3>
		<p>
			A rather new functionality of the toolbox (introduced in v.0.3.47) is an automatic check for updates. There is nothing special about this, and it is a rather crude way of doing it. All it basically does is accessing the toolbox website from within Matlab&reg;. For those interested in more details: The toolbox homepage as given by the function <tt>trEPRinfo('url')</tt> is retrieved via <tt>urlread</tt> and the resulting HTML source parsed for the string containing the version number and date of the latest (development) version. Details can be found in the source code of the function <tt>trEPRupdateCheck</tt> itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			In general, Matlab&reg;'s <tt>urlread</tt> routine will probably leave some rather unique marks in the server logs. However, as stated above, these logs are only used for statistical analysis and to ensure proper functioning of the server as such.
		</p>
		<p>
			Those feeling uneasy with automatic update checks (something I can well understand) can refrain from using the function and disable the update check during GUI startup by setting the appropriate configuration flag in the file <tt>trEPRgui.ini</tt>.
		</p>
		<h2>What data does the toolbox itself collect?</h2>
		<p>
			In short: The toolbox writes history records (one of it's key features). History records contain (potentially) sensible personal information.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each toolbox function (ideally) writes a history record of what it did to the data. These history records are appended to the appropriate field of the dataset structure. They contain a structure called &quot;system&quot; that holds your system details (operating system and version, Matlab&reg; version, <em>username</em>).
		</p>
		<p>
			Why the username of your account on the system? The simple answer: To be able to trace who did what to the dataset. Not to blame somebody, but to know whom to ask in case of any questions. As long as the datasets stay in a scientific environment, everything should be alright.
		</p>
		<p>
			If this should be a real issue in the future, there would be different easy ways of coping with it. Either manually iterate through each and every history record and change the username to something arbitrary (potentially faking the other system-specific information as well) or, if requested, providing a function for automatically doing just that.
		</p>
		<p>
			But have in mind: To be taken serious with this approach, you should at least communicate via encrypted email and have all your data securely encrypted on your hard drive. And that is not to say that this would be ridiculous nor paranoid nor that it wouldn't make sense.
		</p>
		<p>
			Having said the above: Happy analysing your data!
