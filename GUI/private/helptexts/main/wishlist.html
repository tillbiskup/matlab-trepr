		<h1>Wishlist</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			There are many ideas what would be cool to have, or simply convenient, or quite necessary...
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is one place to list such ideas, regardless of how easy they would be to implement, and for the time being completely unsorted and uncategorised.
		</p>
		<h2>Undo</h2>
		<p>
			A long-term favourite: Undo the last change(s) you did to a dataset. Eventually with a complete list of tasks being performed on the dataset and with an easy way to decide what to undo.
		</p>
		<p>
			Part of the necessary infrastructure is already available and was part of the key concepts of the complete rewrite of the toolbox: The original dataset is always saved together with the processed data, and the history records of the data processing allow to clearly identify what has been done.
		</p>
		<h2>Report</h2>
		<p>
			Loading a spectrum and automatically creating a full record including the main characteristics of the dataset and a few nice graphical representations highlighting what is important.
		</p>
		<p>
			Given the new command line (CMD) of the GUI, this is not science-fiction any more, but seems a reasonable long-term goal. Of course, the preferred way of creating the report would be the use of LaTeX...
		</p>
		<h2>Fitting</h2>
		<p>
			Something that should have been implemented already long time ago: The possibility to fit at least such things as exponential functions to time traces.
		</p>
		<h2>Conversion of units</h2>
		<p>
			An automatic conversion of units, especially from Gauss to mT, and for the time axis as well to have a more consistent handling of data.
		</p>
		<h2>...and many, many more things</h2>
		<p>
			If you have ideas by yourself, get in touch with me. The better you can describe what you want to be able to do, the higher the chances that it gets implemented one day...
