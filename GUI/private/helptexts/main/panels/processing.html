		<h1>Data processing</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			A set of standard data (pre)processing functions are available from this panel. It is divided into three pages.
		</p>
		<h2>Page 1: Standard and advanced corrections, scaling, frequency correction</h2>
		<p>
			A short description of all the controls of the panel's first page.
		</p>
		<h3>Select dataset</h3>
		<p>
			A list of currently visible datasets.
		</p>
		<h3>Standard corrections</h3>
		<p>
			The two corrections routinely performed on TREPR datasets:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				pretrigger offset compensation (POC)
			</li>
			<li>
				background correction (BGC)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The pretrigger offset compensation subtracts the average of the pretrigger part of every time trace from the whole time trace and therefore corrects for DC offsets in the data that are frequently encountered.
		</p>
		<p>
			The background subtraction is an "fsc2 style" basic background correction that takes the first few time traces, averages over those, and subtracts the average from every time trace of the dataset, therefore correcting for the laser-induced background that is visible in off-resonant signal parts. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Whereas the former can be applied without damage or side effect to every dataset, the same is not necessarily true for the background subtraction.
		</p>
		<h3>Advanced corrections (dialogues)</h3>
		<p>
			For more advanced "corrections", two separate GUI windows are available:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				baseline correction (BLC)
			</li>
			<li>
				accumulation (ACC)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Both GUI windows come with their separate online help.
		</p>
		<h3>Scaling</h3>
		<p>
			Sometimes you want to scale the dataset without using the slider, e.g., if the slider range is not sufficient.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Please note:</strong> This feature does scale directly the intensity of your dataset, and this behaviour may change in the future.
		</p>
		<h3>Frequency correction</h3>
		<p>
			Often, different datasets are recorded at slightly different microwave frequencies. To directly compare those datasets, one needs to correct them for the same frequency.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here you can set a microwave frequency (in GHz, as shown) an apply this to either all or only the current dataset. Alternatively, you can use the &quot;<tt>fc</tt>&quot; command from the GUI CMD.
		</p>
		<h2>Page 2: Smoothing</h2>
		<p>
			A short description of all the controls of the panel's second page.
		</p>
		<h3>Smoothing (running average filter)</h3>
		<p>
			To reduce the noise level, it is often convenient to smooth data with a running average filter with a given filter window.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, three filters are available: boxcar, binomial, and Savitzky-Golay. Whereas boxcar shall normally not be used due to it strongly distorting your signals, the other two have less impact on your overall signal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Be aware of that filtering with a window too large compared to the spectral features can easily lead to distortions of the spectra (comparable to "overmodulating" in cw-EPR). Therefore, use with care.
		</p>
		<h2>Page 3: Arithmetics</h2>
		<p>
			A short description of all the controls of the panel's third page.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note that the underlying functions for arithmetics (add, subtract, ...) are still quite buggy. Therefore, use with care if at all...
