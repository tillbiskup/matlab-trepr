		<h1>Measure</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			Often, one wants to measure either positions (single points) or distances (between two points) in datasets.
		</p>
		<p>
			To measure positions, simply press the "Point" button at the bottom of the "Measure" panel, to measure distances, the "Distance" button, respectively.
		</p>
		<h2>The controls</h2>
		<p>
			A short description of all the controls of the panel.
		</p>
		<h3>Coordinates</h3>
		<p>
			Coordinates (both as index and in actual units) of the first point (x1, y1, z1), the second point (x2, y2, z2, if available) and the distance between two points (Dx, Dy, Dz, if available). If you just want to measure positions (single points), this is at the same time the only active part.
		</p>
		<p>
			A convenient way of setting the position sliders both in x and y direction, you can tick the "Set sliders" box in the "Settings" subpanel below. In that case, the values for both x and y will be used to adjust the position slider for the 1D display modes. Therefore, if you just click onto a maximum in 2D plot mode, you can immediately see slices in both x and y direction at that particular position (with maximum signal). 
		</p>
		<p>
			To clear a measurement, simply press the "Clear" button that will reset all three displays (but not the position sliders).
		</p>
		<h3>Settings</h3>
		<p>
			As mentioned above, you can set the sliders for a single point measurement.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, you can add the point picking or distance measurement to the list of characteristics (here: point of interest, POI, and distance of interest, DOI, respectively). This allows you to set certain distances and points as characteristics in a dataset that can be referred to later, e.g., in a report.
