		<h1>Data analysis</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			This panel gives access to different means of data analysis.
		</p>
		<h2>The controls</h2>
		<p>
			A short description of all the controls of the panel.
		</p>
		<h3>MW frequency drift</h3>
		<p>
			This can be only used with datasets where for each time trace a microwave frequency value is recorded (as in case of the Freiburg data).
		</p>
		<p>
			Pressing the <key>Show</key> button will open an additional GUI window displaying the MW frequency versus field. Such, drifts of the MW frequency that have some impact on the signal can easily be revealed.
		</p>
		<h3>Net polarisation</h3>
		<p>
			Sometimes it is useful to get an idea of the net polarisation of a dataset. Therefore, a sum projection over each time trace is displayed in an additional GUI window upon pressing the <key>Show</key> button.
		</p>
		<h3>BG positions</h3>
		<p>
			For recording schemes as those used in Freiburg where the background signal is recorded repeatedly over the time course of the measurement at off-resonant position, sometimes it is useful to see where such background traces have been recorded to get an idea whether some &quot;wiggles&quot; are real features of your spectra or artifacts introduced by drifts followed by background subtraction.
		</p>
		<p>
			Displaying background positions works only in 2D mode and in 1D mode showing spectra (with magnetic field axis).
