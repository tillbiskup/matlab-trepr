    </head>
    <body>
		<h1>Display settings</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			The display panel is currently by far the most complex single panel of the main GUI window, divided into seven pages, each dealing with a related subset of display-related settings.
		</p>
		<h2>Page 1: Axis labels, limits, and display</h2>
		<p>
			Both axis labels and axis limits can be set manually for all three axes.
		</p>
		<p>
			The axis labels can be determined from the currently active dataset (if possible), the axis limits are normally set to "automatic", meaning that they are optimised to fit all currently visible datasets into the axes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, you can set whether the y axis, y ticks, title and box are shown/drawn.
		</p>
		<h2>Page 2: Grid, zero line, legend, 2D display settings</h2>
		<h3>Grid</h3>
		<p>
			A zero line is displayed by default in case of the 1D representations (but not for the 2D display), grids in x and y direction can be added independently, and the minor grid can be added (simultaneously for both axes).
		</p>
		<p>
			In this particular case, x and y refers to the abscissa and ordinate of the current display, not to the x, y, and z dimensions of the dataset, as everywhere else.
		</p>
		<h3>Zero line settings</h3>
		<p>
			A zero line is normally quite useful in 1D display modes. Here, you can set colour, line style and width of the zero line (but not markers, as it seems not to make too much sense to do so).
		</p>
		<h3>Legend</h3>
		<p>
			Legends are only displayed in 1D mode. You can determine the legend position manually (NW, NE, SW, SE) or let Matlab(r) determine what it thinks is the "optimal" position.
		</p>
		<h3>2D display settings</h3>
		<p>
			Sometimes, if looking at 2D datasets in 2D display mode, one wants to control the colour map in certain ways to have a better comparison between different datasets.
		</p>
		<p>
			Therefore, you can set here each dataset to use its individual colour map (using <tt>imagesc</tt> internally, this means that colours get scaled to minimum and maximum of the dataset) and/or to use a symmetric colour map (with zero intensity always in the same colour).
		</p>
		<h2>Page 3: Normalisation, Highlight, display additional features</h2>
		<h3>Normalisation</h3>
		<p>
			As signal intensity of TREPR spectra depends in a far from straightforward way on a couple of both experimental (i.e., related to the current setup) and inherent (overlap and thus cancellation of absorptive and emissive lines in the spectrum) parameters, it normally cannot be used for quantitative analysis of the spectra.
		</p>
		<p>
			Therefore, to directly compare, e.g., the decay of two different time traces, or the shape of two different spectra, normalisation of the datasets is quite helpful.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are four different types of normalisation provided with the GUI: peak-to-peak (labelled Pk2Pk), area, min and max. Whereas peak-to-peak sets the complete peak-to-peak-amplitude to one, area does so with the area. The last two options set either minimum or maximum to -1 or 1, respectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, you can choose whether you want to apply the normalisation in 1D or 2D dimensions.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Please note:</strong> On the bottom right of the main GUI window will appear a yellow indicator if normalisation is switched on.
		</p>
		<h3>Highlight of current dataset</h3>
		<p>
			To be able to distinguish between the currently active and other visible datasets, by default the currently active dataset is highlighted with blue colour, with all other datasets displayed with black lines.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here, both method and value for the given method of highlighting can be controlled, and one can switch off the highlighting completely. The latter is of special interest for exporting figures, where no highlighting of the "currently active dataset" is necessary, and indeed rather confusing.
		</p>
		<h3>Display additional features</h3>
		<p>
			Sometimes it is useful to have additional features of a dataset displayed. Curently, you can choose between the following options:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Standard deviation (mainly useful for averaged datasets)</li>
			<li>Simulation - the contents of the <tt>calculated</tt> field of the dataset</li>
			<li>Characteristics - will be explained somewhere else in more detail.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Each option will only have some effect if the underlying data are contained in the dataset(s) currently displayed.
		</p>
		<h2>Page 4: Projection and residuals axes</h2>
		<h3>Projection axes</h3>
		<p>
			Only used in 2D display mode, you will get additional axes in both dimensions. You can select whether the current slice or the sum projection is shown in the respective projection axis, and you can set the axis height/width.
		</p>
		<h3>Residuals axes</h3>
		<p>
			Only useful in case of simulations/fits contained in a dataset. You can display the residuals between simulation and measured data. Additionally you can set the height of the residuals axis and the gap between main axis and residuals axis.
		</p>
		<h2>Page 5: Line settings</h2>
		<p>
			To distinguish between different (visible) datasets, the line settings of each dataset can be controlled as far as Matlab(r) allows to do so, meaning line colour, width, style, and marker.
		</p>
		<p>
NOTE: If "highlight currently active" is switched on, it will most probably interfere with the settings. Therefore, if the line settings seem not to work properly, you should switch of the highlighting as a first step.
		</p>
		<p>
			To show only the (unconnected) data points, set "Style" to none and choose from one of the "Markers".
		</p>
		<h2>Page 6: 3D display</h2>
		<p>
			A 3D representation of 2D datasets (with intensity as third dimension) is sometimes used for an overview of a given 2D dataset. The 3D display panel allows the user to generate such datasets, that are normally restricted in their resolution (as a full 200x500 point or even larger dataset will be quite huge and slow in display).
		</p>
		<p>
			Furthermore, these 3D views can be exported in the same way as the main display. To export the current 3D display to a file, choose the file type (currently Matlab(r) FIG, EPS, PDF, PNG) and hit "Export".
		</p>
		<p>
			NOTE: If you just hit "Export" without having an actual 3D display window, no figure will be exported.
		</p>
		<p>
			The "Format" popupmenu allows to specify a format (aspect ratio, size of the graphics) that makes it easier to use the saved figures, e.g., in reports. These formats can be fully customised using the "fig2file.ini" file in the same directory as the "fig2file" function.
		</p>
		<h2>Page 7: Export figure</h2>
		<p>
			What is a GUI worth that does not allow to save the current display in an easy way to a file?
		</p>
		<h3>Export figure</h3>
		<p>
To export the current display to a file, choose the file type (currently Matlab(r) FIG, EPS, PDF, PNG) and hit "Export".
		</p>
		<p>
			The "Format" popupmenu allows to specify a format (aspect ratio, size of the graphics) that makes it easier to use the saved figures, e.g., in reports. These formats can be fully customised using the "fig2file.ini" file in the same directory as the "fig2file" function.
