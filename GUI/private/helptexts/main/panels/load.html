        <title>trEPR GUI : Main window : Load data</title>
    </head>
    <body>
		<h1>Load data</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			The "Load" panel contains all controls necessary to load datasets to the GUI.
		</p>
		<p>
			The basic unit of the trEPR GUI is a "dataset", be it 1D or 2D. Normally, one dataset consists of a single measurement, i.e. a 2D measurement of TREPR data (B0 vs. time).
		</p>
		<h2>The Controls</h2>
		<p>
			A short description of all the controls of the panel.
		</p>
		<h3>File type</h3>
		<p>
			This popupmenu allows to preselect settings of the checkboxes below. "Automatic" should work in many cases, as the toolbox is capable of detecting the file types automatically and loads the datasets accordingly. For loading raw data recorded in Freiburg (&quot;speksim&uqot; format), please choose the appropriate entry.
		</p>
		<h3>Files to load</h3>
		<p>
			You can select to
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				combine multiple files, or to
			</li>
			<li>
				load all (readable) files of a directory.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		    Additionally, you can select to automatically load the corresponding info file of a dataset. If ticked, the GUI will try to find a fitting info file for your dataset(s), read and apply it to your dataset(s).
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Please note:</strong> This option has no effect on data in the trEPR toolbox format. If you want to apply info files to those datasets, use the Info GUI.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please, be especially careful with "combining multiple files", as it is intended to be used in case that you have datasets consisting of multiple files, normally one file per time trace (as it is the case for the TREPR data in Freiburg).
		</p>
		<h3>Preprocessing on load</h3>
		<p>
			Basically, there are two corrections that are applied regularly to TREPR datasets:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The pretrigger offset compensation (POC), and 
			</li>
			<li>
				the background subtraction (BGC)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The pretrigger offset compensation subtracts the average of the pretrigger part of every time trace from the whole time trace and therefore corrects for DC offsets in the data that are frequently encountered.
		</p>
		<p>
			The background subtraction is an "fsc2 style" basic background correction that takes the first few time traces, averages over those, and subtracts the average from every time trace of the dataset, therefore correcting for the laser-induced background that is visible in off-resonant signal parts. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Whereas the former can be applied without damage or side effect to every dataset, the same is not necessarily true for the background subtraction.
		</p>
		<p>
			If in doubt, don't check the boxes and perform the corrections afterwards manually (via the "Processing" panel) while inspecting the data.
		</p>
		<h3>Display options</h3>
		<p>
			For convenience, there is a number of options that you can set for the display, namely:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Determine the axis labels automatically from the data loaded.</li>
			<li>Make dataset visible upon load, i.e., not adding it toÂ the set of invisible datasets at start, but to the visible ones.</li>
			<li>Convert units, currently the field axis from G to mT.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Please note: If labels could not be determined from the dataset, defaults apply. If more than one dataset is loaded at the same time, the last dataset "wins" in terms of axes labels.
		</p>
		<h3>The "Load" button</h3>
		<p>
			Finally, pressing the "Load" button opens the file selection dialogue and allows you to select the files/the directory you want to load datasets from.
