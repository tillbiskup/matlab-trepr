In terms of scientific data processing and analysis:

Although great care has been taken to provide you with a set of functions that perform correct and in scientific means valid operations on the data you process with this software, the author of the software is in no way responsible nor liable for the results.

It is solely your responsibility to keep a complete record of operations you performed on your datasets, including the details of the software used (i.e., names and versions of the routines).

In general, this GUI writes records to the "history" array of a dataset each time it performs some operation, to help the user with keeping a complete record of performed tasks. Nevertheless, there is no warranty that these informations are correct nor complete.
