		<h1>Display</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			The display panel provides you with additional controls of the display, as well as (most probably) the possibility to export/save the plot.
		</p>
		<h2>Grid</h2>
		<p>
			Grids in x and y direction can be added independently, and the minor grid can be added (simultaneously for both axes).
		</p>
		<p>
			In this particular case, x and y refers to the abscissa and ordinate of the current display, not to the x, y, and z dimensions of the dataset, as everywhere else.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Zero" toggles between displaying a zero line.
		</p>
		<h2>Pretrigger statistics</h2>
		<p>
			To help analyse the net polarisation, you can display both mean and standard deviation (as area, mean +/- stdev) of the pretrigger part of the signal independently or together. Additionally, you can display min and max of the pretrigger part of the signal as area.
		</p>
		<h2>Smoothing (running average filter)</h2>
		<p>
			To get a bit better an idea of how the time evolution of the net polarisation of your spectrum looks, it is often helpful to smooth the curve displayed, given that the sum along the magnetic field axis is often quite noisy.
		</p>
		<p>
			The controls are basically the same as those in the main GUI, allowing you to select a filter function and set the filter window width (both, as points and in real units of the time axis).
		</p>
		<p>
			The smoothed curve will only be displayed if you select a filter window > 1 point. The standard settings for the smoothed line can be set in the corresponding ini file of the Net Polarisation GUI.
		</p>
		<h2>Export figure</h2>
		<p>
To export the current display to a file, choose the file type (currently Matlab&trade; FIG, EPS, PDF, PNG) and hit "Export".
		</p>
		<p>
			The "Format" popupmenu allows to specify a format (aspect ratio, size of the graphics) that makes it easier to use the saved figures, e.g., in reports. These formats can be fully customised using the "fig2file.ini" file in the same directory as the "fig2file" function.
