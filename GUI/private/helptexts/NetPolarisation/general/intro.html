		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			A rather short introduction to the Net Polarisation Analysis GUI.
		</p>
		<div class="hurry">
		<h2>If in a hurry</h2>
		<p>
			Suppose you just want to check whether you have some net polarisation in your TREPR spectrum at any given time. Given that you have loaded a 2D dataset with the EPR signal as function of B0 and time, S(B0,t), this GUI will immediately plot the net polarisation as function of time and calculate min, max, delta, average and standard deviation of the net polarisation values for you. The colour coding of the net polarisation (green = no net polarisation, blue = net emissive polarisation, red = net absorptive polarisation) lets you easily check for existing net polarisation in your dataset.
		</p>
		</div>
		<h2>To the gentle reader</h2>
		<p>
			The Net Polarisation Analysis GUI is dedicated to the task of analysing the net polarisation of a TREPR dataset as function of time. This is particularly important for getting a first hint of the precursor state of the RP and the spin evolution.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> If your loaded dataset does not contain a time axis with more than one value, there is currently nothing this GUI can do for you.
		</p>
		<h3>GUI layout</h3>
		<p>
			Basically, the Net Polarisation Analysis GUI window is divided into two parts: The main axis to the left and three panels to the right. You can switch between the panels on the right with the buttons on the top or via shortcuts <key>Ctrl-1</key> to <key>Ctrl-3</key>.
		</p>
		<p>
			More details to all the different panels and the meaning of their control elements can be found in the respective help topic:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="../panels/analysis.html">Analysis</a></li>
			<li><a href="../panels/display.html">Display</a></li>
			<li><a href="../panels/settings.html">Settings</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			What follows is a sketch of the typical operation of this GUI.
		</p>
		<p>
			BTW: The button with the questionmark shows this help, as you might have figured out already.
		</p>
		<h3>Normal operation</h3>
		<p>
			Normally, as this GUI is dedicated to an analysis rather than a data modification task, you simply open it and will immediately see the net polarisation plotted as a function of time. All necessary values are immediately displayed in the "Analysis" panel to the right after you opened the GUI. The colour code of the fields in the "Net polarisation" subpanel will immediately tell you whether you have net polarisation in your spectrum{. More information about the colour coding and their meaning can be found in the <a href="../panels/analysis.html">respective help topic</a></del>.
		</p>
		<p>
			To close the Net Polarisation Analysis GUI, simply hit the "Close" button on the bottom right. This will bring you back to the main GUI. Alternatively, you may press <key>Esc</key> or <key>Ctrl+w</key>.
