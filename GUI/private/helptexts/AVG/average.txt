AVERAGE

The average panel lets you set all the parameters necessary for the averaging and lets you perform the actual averaging.


Average dimension

The average dimension popupmenu lets you choose between the two axes you can average over. 

NOTE: If you already averaged along one dimension, but have not pressed "Apply", then all your settings from that averaging get reset when changing the average dimension, even if you go back to the original dimension.


Label for new dataset

Every dataset in the GUI should have a unique label as an easy identifier. Therefore, the AVG GUI makes a recommendation for a label.


Average area

The average area can be defined in terms of start and stop values or a start and a delta value.

Therefore: If you change the delta value, it will change the stop value as well, but keep the start value constant. If your delta value is too big for the current settings of the start value and given the size of the dataset in the particular dimension, then the delta value gets reset to the maximum possible value for the given start value.
