		<h1>Tools</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			This panel provides you with additional tools.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Please note:</strong> Currently, most of the panel is just a technical preview without any functionality. As soon as time allows, fuctions will be added. That may well lead to a complete restructuring of the panel.
		</p>
		<p>
			Below is just a short explanation of what functions are planned.
		</p>
		<h2>Report</h2>
		<p>
			Some may remember from earlier versions of the toolbox that there was such thing as a report generator that created PDF files (via LaTeX) giving both a summary of all parameters of a dataset and display the dataset via a series of figures showing different of its aspects.
		</p>
		<p>
			This panel will provide the user with all necessary controls to create such reports.
		</p>
		<h2>LIS</h2>
		<p>
			Try to find out what "LIS" may stand for, if you don't already know. Plans are that this panel will give you - at some point in the far future - access to such a system (that beforehand has to be layed out, implemented, and installed), and therefore provide you with all functionality necessary to have a structured, accessible and useful storage of both data and information.
