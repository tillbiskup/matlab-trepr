		<h1>Parameters of the measurement</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			This panel displays all the parameters of the dataset that are stored in the parameters structure of the current dataset.
		</p>
		<p>
Not every dataset has originally values for all the fields, and not every field is editable (especially, a few of the units for different fields are fixed).
		</p>
		<p>
			Be especially careful with the fields marked accordingly, as changing their values might corrupt your dataset.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you change some of the parameters in a way that would obviously corrupt your dataset, the respective fields get marked in red, and those parameters are not applied to the dataset.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to the wealth of parameters, the panel has been divided into several subpanels, called "pages" here. To switch between the pages, use the buttons on top.
		</p>
		<h2>Sample</h2>
		<p>
