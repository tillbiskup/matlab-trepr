Position - Position in x and y, both as index of the axes vectors and in axis units.

Scaling - Scaling in x,y,z, both as index of the axes vectors and in axis units.

Displacement - Displacement in x,y,z, both as index of the axes vectors and in axis units.

Smoothing - Running average settings in x and y, both as index of the axes vectors and in axis units. The "type" control holds the method currently used for the smoothing (running average filtering)


AXES

All the information contained in the "axis" structure of a dataset that was loaded into the main GUI.

Axis labels - Labels of the x,y,z axes.

Axis limits - Limits of the x,y,z axes
