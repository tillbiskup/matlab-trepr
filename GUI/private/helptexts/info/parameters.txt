PARAMETERS OF THE MEASUREMENT

This panel displays all the parameters of the dataset that are stored in the parameters structure of the current dataset.

Not every dataset has originally values for all the fields, and not every field is editable (especially, a few of the units for different fields are fixed).

Be especially careful with the fields marked accordingly, as chaning their values might corrupt your dataset.


GENERAL

General information about the current dataset.

No. of runs - Number of runs, that is not the number of averages, but the number of complete runs (including the whole field sweep). Normally, this is only used in connection with fsc2.

Temperature - The temperature the actual experiment was performed at.

Operator - The username/real name of the person recording the data. Currently, this is only determined automatically for Bruker BES3T files.


TRANSIENT

Information about the time traces (transients) the dataset consists of.

No. of points - Length of the time trace in points

Trigger pos. - Position of the trigger pulse within the time trace; in points

Length - Length of the time trace in actual units; you can specify the unit as well.


RECORDER

Information about the transient recorder used to record the time traces.

Sensitivity - The sensitivity setting of the transient recorder (oscilloscope) used to acquire the data. Normally, this is given as "per division". 

Averages - Number of averages

Time base - Time base of the transient recorder (oscilloscope) used to acquire the data. Normally, this is given as "per division".

Bandwidth - Bandwidth of the transient recorder (oscilloscope).

Model - A string identifying the model of the transient recorder, e.g. "Tektronix TDS520A".


FIELD

Information about the magnetic field range over which the data were recorded.

Start - Position on the field axis where the field sweep started.

End - Position on the field axis where the field sweep ended.

Step - Stepping of the magnetic field axis.

Calibration start - Position of the field axis where the field sweep started, measured with an NMR gaussmeter.

Calibration end - Position of the field axis where the field sweep ended, measured with an NMR gaussmeter.


BRIDGE

Information about the microwave bridge used to record the data and its settings.

MW frequency - Microwave frequency the experiment was performed at.

Calib. fq. start - Microwave frequency at the start of the experiment, read from a frequency counter.

Calib. fq. end - Microwave frequency at the end of the experiment/current run, read from a frequency counter.

Attenuation - Attenuation (in dB)

Power - Actual microwave power (as different MW bridges have different maximum power and therefore, the "attenuation" field is not sufficient).

Bandwidth - Bandwidth of the video amplifier in the MW bridge.

Amplification - Amplification in the video amplifier of the MW bridge.

Model - A string identifying the model of the bridge used, e.g. "Bruker ER 046 XK-T".


LASER

Information about the laser system used for the data acquisition.

Wavelength - The wavelength (in nm) used for the experiment.

Rep. rate - The repetition rate (in Hz) of the laser system used for the experiment.

Power - The laser power

Model - A string identifyling the model of the laser used, e.g. "SpectraPhysics GCR-11".

OPO/Dye - A string identifying the model/type of the OPO/dye used to change the wavelength, e.g. "OPTA BBO-355-vis/IR".
