GENERAL INFORMATION

This panel contains general information about the dataset.


FILE

All fields are read-only. Nevertheless, you can copy&paste things from these fields (and therefore, strictly speaking, edit them, although any edits made here will make no difference to the dataset). 

Path - The path of the file that was loaded into the GUI containing the data of the dataset. Normally, that should be the full path and not a relative path.

Filename - The name of the actual file that was loaded into the GUI containing the data of the dataset.

Format - !Not supported yet! Will display the file format (fsc2, Bruker BES3T, ...)


DATASET

Label - The label used to display the dataset in the GUI. In case of Bruker BES3T files, this defaults to the label specified in Xepr. Of course, this field is editable.


HEADER

Contains the header of the original file containing the data of the dataset. In case of Bruker BES3T files, this is the contents of the DSC file.
