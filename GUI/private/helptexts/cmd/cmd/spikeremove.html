		<h1>spikreremove</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			Remove spikes (artifacts) in datasets using interpolation.
		</p>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
		    Spikes (artifacts) often result from transient detuning of the cavity during the measurement process, particularly if the background is subtracted already in the transient recorder.
	    </p>
	    <p>
			The <tt>spikreremove</tt> command takes field positions as option(s) and performs interpolation for these field points.
		</p>
		<h2>Syntax</h2>
		<p>
			<tt>spikreremove positions</tt>
		</p>
		<h3>Options</h3>
		<p>
			All options are interpreted as (list of) field positions in the unit of the given dataset.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can use all the different notation options for vectors Matlab(r) provides, as <tt>str2num</tt> is used internally to convert the options into a vector of field positions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The function checks for the positions to exist in the dataset. If there is any problem, the function will issue a warning and return.
		</p>
		<h3>Warning</h3>
		<p>
			Please note that this function is very close to manipulating data in a bad way and therefore not recommended for general use or data to be published. It is always better to record a dataset again that contains spikes this function can remove.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that additional artifacts are introduced by this function. Therefore, use it entirely on your own risk and responsibility.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	The fact that this function has been applied to a dataset is documented in the dataset's history - unless some (evil) person removes this history record by purpose.
