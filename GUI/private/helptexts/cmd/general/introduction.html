		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			A rather short introduction to the Command Line of the trEPR GUI.
		</p>
		<div class="hurry">
		<h2>If in a hurry</h2>
		<p>
			If you know the command you want to use, just type it into the command line and press <key>Return</key>. If you're not using the toolbox regularly, just continue using your mouse. This is most probably the much more convenient way for you. If unhappy, RTFM...
		</p>
		</div>
		<h2>To the gentle reader</h2>
		<p>
			The Command Line of the trEPR GUI is a rather powerful tool, allowing the user (once it will be implemented properly) to perform most of the tasks by typing commands on the keyboard. This comes on cost of having to remember the commands.
		</p>
		<h3>General syntax</h3>
		<p>
			In general, you type a <tt>&lt;command&gt;</tt> that might be followed by one or more additional parameters. Commands are not case sensitive, command and parameter(s) are separated by single spaces.
		</p>
		<h3>Command line history</h3>
		<p>
			Within one session of the trEPR GUI, the command line history is saved and can be accessed as usual by using the arrow keys.
		</p>
		<h3>Getting help for a particular command</h3>
		<p>
			If you are interested in help for a specific command of the command line of the trEPR GUI, you can type either <tt>help</tt> or simply <tt>?</tt>, followed by the command <tt>&lt;command&gt;</tt> you are interested in as a parameter. For example:
		</p>
		<pre><code>help disp</code></pre>
		<p>
			will display the help for the <tt>disp</tt> command.
		</p>
		<p>
			To get an overview of all the commands currently implemented in the command line of the trEPR GUI toolbox, just type
		</p>
		<pre><code>help commands</code></pre>
		<p>
			and have a look at the list on the left side of the window.
