		<h1>Scripting</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			The command line (CMD), once properly implemented, provides the user with the possibility to control most parts of the GUI. This immediately leads to the idea of scripting: performing tasks by running a set of commands saved in a file.
		</p>
		<div class="hurry">
		<h2>If in a hurry</h2>
		<p>
			Scripting allows you to perform a set of commands by loading a script rather than by typing the commands one by one into the command line. The feature is currently still EXPERIMENTAL.
		</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Running scripts</h2>
		<p>
			Currently, the only way to run a script is from the "internal" panel of the GUI. There you can load a script file and execute it. In the future, there will appear a <tt>run</tt> command in the command line for this.
		</p>
		<h2>Scripting: A few ideas</h2>
		<p>
			At the time of writing this text, scripting is still in its infancy. Therefore, this help serves currently as a reminder of what would be nice to have in the future.
		</p>
		<h3>Scripts for standard tasks</h3>
		<p>
			The power of scripting comes in very handy if certain tasks should be performed regularly on a dataset. Here, a well-written (and documented) script can save a lot of time.
		</p>
		<h3>Header of script files</h3>
		<p>
			Each script is just a collection of commands known by the CMD feature of the toolbox. Already now, command lines are allowed. That would allow for using a header for each script file making it easier to get an idea what the script was all about, what purpose it serves, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fields for such a header would be a short description, perhaps keywords, an author and a date - and perhaps even more fields. For an idea why this would be useful, see the next section.
		</p>
		<h3>GUI for flicking through and loading scripts</h3>
		<p>
			The idea: a GUI window similar to what exists already for loading snapshots: A listbox for selecting the script, and for each selected script a few additional informations making it much easier to decide whether this is the correct one.
