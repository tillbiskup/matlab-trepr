		<h1>Variables</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			Often, particularly in context of <a href="scripting.html">scripting</a>, using variables is quite useful, if not necessary. Therefore, variables have been introduced with version 0.3.37 of the toolbox.
		</p>
		<div class="hurry">
		<h2>If in a hurry</h2>
		<p>
			Variables can be set using the command <tt><a href="../cmd/define.html">define</a></tt> and used by typing the variable name with &quot;$&quot; as a prefix. There exists as well a set of predefined variables with special meaning. The feature is currently still EXPERIMENTAL.
		</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Defining variables</h2>
		<p>
			Variables can be set using the command <tt><a href="../cmd/define.html">define</a></tt>. Just to give an example:
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>define foo = bar</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			For further information see the respective <a href="../cmd/define.html">command reference page</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Using variables</h2>
		<p>
			Variables can be used as <em>options</em> in every command. They get expanded prior to parsing the actual command.
		</p>
		<p>
			To use a variable, just prepend its name with the <tt>$</tt> sign.
		</p>
		<h3>Predefined variables</h3>
		<p>
			There is a (growing) number of predefined variables for special tasks. Following a list of these special (predefined) variables and their meaning:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>current</dt>
			<dd>Index of the currently active dataset.</dd>
			<dt>date</dt>
			<dd>Date the currently active dataset has been recorded.</dd>
			<dt>label</dt>
			<dd>Label of the currently active dataset.</dd>
			<dd>If you append <tt>#&lt;index&gt;</tt>, the label of the dataset corresponding to <tt>index</tt> will be returned. For details, see below.</dd>
			<dt>pwd</dt>
			<dd>Current directory (on the Matlab command line).</dd>
			<dd>(The command is issued in the Matlab &quot;base&quot; workspace.)</dd>
			<dt>ndatasets|numberofdatasets</dt>
			<dd>Number of currently loaded datasets (sum of invisible and visible)</dd>
			<dt>today</dt>
			<dd>Current date.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h3>Special case: dataset-specific variables</h3>
		<p>
			Guess you want to average parts of a dataset and reuse its label for the new dataset (just appending additional information). As long as you work on the currently active dataset, this can be done using just <tt>$label</tt>.
		</p>
		<p>
			But what if you want to refer to a label of a specific dataset? All you need to know is the internal index of the dataset, as (now) displayed in the listboxes of datasets. To get the label of, let's say, the second dataset (if there is such thing as a second dataset), just type <tt>$label#2</tt>. Here, it doesn't matter whether you prepend the index with zeros, <tt>$label#002</tt> will do the same for you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently (version 0.3.49) this works only with <tt>label</tt> and <tt>date</tt>, but it will most probably be expanded as soon as there is some need for other variables as well.
