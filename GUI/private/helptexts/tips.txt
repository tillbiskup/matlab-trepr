You can <strong>close this window</strong> by hiting "Esc" or "Ctrl-w", or with the "Close" button.

You can <strong>close every window</strong> of the trEPR Toolbox GUI by hitting "Ctrl-w".

The new <strong>toolbox file format</strong> saves the data as binary (32-bit float) to save memory and speed up loading.

Double-click on a dataset in the dataset listbox lets you <strong>change its label</strong>. Try it out!

The topic &quot;<strong>New features</strong>&quot; in the trEPR Toolbox Help window lists the new features of every version.

Nearly every GUI window can now be <strong>configured</strong>, easiest using the "Configure panel" of the Main GUI.

The GUI comes with extensive <strong>built-in help</strong>. You can access it by either hitting "F1" or pressing the button with the blue question mark.

The help usually contains a section "<strong>If in a hurry</strong>" for the busy users.

<strong>Power users</strong> may set "<tt>welcome = 0</tt>" in the Main GUI configuration file for a faster start.

You can scroll with the <strong>arrow keys</strong>, &larr; and &rarr;, of your <em>keyboard</em> through these tips.

You can <strong>display a legend</strong>, and even move it around with the mouse. But beware: It may slightly change position during export.

You can use <strong>TeX strings</strong> in axis and dataset labels, such as <tt>\Delta</tt>, to display Greek characters. 

The <strong>labels</strong> of your datasets get used in the figure legend. Use that for proper figure legends.

If you don't provide a unit for an axis label, the slash will not be displayed.

You can scroll through the visible datasets using the "PgUp" and "PgDown" keys.

The MW Frequency Drift Analysis Window lets you analyse MW frequency drifts in quite some detail. See the analysis panel.

If you have averaged datasets, you can display the standard deviation as error bars Set the option in the display panel.

You can configure the position of the main GUI via the INI file. Subwindows are positioned relative to the main GUI window.

You can read trEPR Info Files using the Info GUI. That helps you greatly with applying all parameters from the Info files to datasets.

Files saved in older versions of the trEPR toolbox format get converted during read.

You can change between supanels in the parameters panel of the Info GUI with "Ctrl+Shift+<number>".

"Ctrl+l" switches the focus to the command line.

You can use the new command line to start controlling your toolbox via keyboard.

The "Net Polarisation Analysis Window" lets you analyse the time development of the net polarisation in your TREPR spectra with ease.

You can switch between the different modes with keyboard shortcuts: "s" for scroll, "c" for scale, "d" for displace, "z" for zoom, "Esc" to leave the mode(s).

The status display on the bottom right of the main GUI allows you to have the current toolbox status always under control. It is reset by opening the status window.

You can get help for any command in the command line using the command <tt>?</tt> followed by the command you would get help displayed for.

You can save information along with a figure - with the new Figure Caption GUI. Simply check the box in the display panel.

You can open a .tez file from within Matlab(tm) by simply double-clicking on the file. This will start the trEPR GUI if necessary and display the file.

"Ctrl+o" opens the file selection dialogue for loading new dataa.

You can control the colormap for 2D plots in some detail: Same colormap for all visible datasets, symmetric colormap centered around zero. Furthermore you can add a colorbar when exporting 2D figures.

You can remove unwanted spikes (artifacts) using either the CMD "spikeremove" or directy the underlying function trEPRspikeRemoval

If you use the "pick" command, it will display x,y,z values in the status window.

You can use "doc" as alias for "help" in CMD.

You can set characteristics (points, POI, distances, DOI, slices, SOI) of a dataset for further analysis.

Interested in scripting? CMD now understands variables (to some extent).

Multiple spectra/time traces and bored to manually stack 'em? Use "stack" - and "unstack" if unhappy.

Numbers of datasets are now displayed in front of their labels in the list boxes.
