DATASETS

The datasets panel lets you choose which of the datasets currently loaded in the main GUI should be accumulated, define which dataset to use as a "master" (more about that below) and choose a label for the accumulated data.


Datasets lists

There are two lists of datasets, the upper being the one with the datasets not to accumulate, the lower showing the datasets that should be accumulated. The two buttons "Add" and "Remove" move the dataset selected in the respective list to the other list.

When opening the ACC GUI, all datasets that were set to "invisible" in the main GUI show up in the list of not accumulated datasets, whereas all datasets set to "visible" in the main GUI will be in the list of accumulated (i.e., "to accumulate") spectra.


Master dataset

Only important if you have datasets with different spacing of the axes and/or if you use interpolation (i.e., in case of nonidentical axis values, but overlapping axes regions), this popup menu lets you choose which dataset to use as a master defining the "template" the axes of all other datasets get interpolated to (if necessary).

 
Label for new dataset

Every dataset loaded has a label (although not necessarily a unique one, as they get recognised internally not by their label, so you are free to use whatever label suits best your needs). As accumulation creates a new dataset, you can (and should) specify a label for it here.
