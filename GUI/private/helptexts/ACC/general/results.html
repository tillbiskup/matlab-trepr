		<h1>Results</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			The results panel provides you with means of inspecing the results of the performed accumulation procedure.
		</p>
		<h2>Master dataset</h2>
		<p>
			Only important if you have datasets with different spacing of the axes and/or if you use interpolation (i.e., in case of nonidentical axis values, but overlapping axes regions), this popup menu lets you choose which dataset to use as a master defining the "template" the axes of all other datasets get interpolated to (if necessary).
		</p>
		<p>
			The first two subpanels let you control what you see in the main axis on the top left, both in terms of display type and position (if available).
		</p>
		<p>
			The main axes provide you with means of inspecting the result of the accumulation process. Especially, this allows you to carefully check the results before finally applying the changes and returning to the main GUI.
		</p>
		<h2>Position</h2>
		<p>
			Given that you loaded a 2D dataset and are currently displaying a 1D representation along one of the two axes, you can set and get the axis positions along x and y here, both as index and unit (if available).
		</p>
		<h2>Dimensions</h2>
		<p>
			In terms of its controls identical to the subpanel of the datasets panel, the dimensions subpanel gives you an easy overview over the dimensions of the accumulated (i.e. newly created) dataset. 
		</p>
		<h2>Label for new dataset</h2>
		<p>
			Every dataset loaded has a label (although not necessarily a unique one, as they get recognised internally not by their label, so you are free to use whatever label suits best your needs). As accumulation creates a new dataset, you can (and should) specify a label for it here.
		</p>
		<h2>Report</h2>
		<p>
			To the left, below the main axes, you can find a more detailed report of the actual accumulation that was performed, along with any problems that might have occured during that process.
		</p>
		<p>
			A more detailed description of the report is given in the <a href="report.html">respective help topic</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			To save that report to a text file, you may use the "save" button provided in the report subpanel of the results panel.
