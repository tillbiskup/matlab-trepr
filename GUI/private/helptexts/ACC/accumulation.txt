ACCUMULATION SETTINGS

The accumulation settings panel lets you choose between (currently two) different types of accumulation: cumulative sum and weighted sum.

Normally you want to choose the first option, cumulative sum. This performs a simple sum operation on the selected datasets (of course handling all other things as choosing the overlapping part of the axes and interpolate if necessary).

If you choose "Weighted" it performs a sum weighted by the best achievable signal to noise ratio. Additionally, you can specify the minimum and maximum weighting factor.
