DISPLAY SETTINGS

The display settings panel allows you to control what you see in the main axis on the top left, both in terms of display type and position (if available).

The main axes provide you with means of inspecting the result of the accumulation process. Especially, this allows you to carefully check the results before finally applying the changes and returning to the main GUI.


Position

Given that you loaded a 2D dataset and are currently displaying a 1D representation along one of the two axes, you can set and get the axis positions along x and y here, both as index and unit (if available).


Display type

The display type popupmenu is the well-known control element from the main GUI that allows you to switch between 2D and 1D representations.
