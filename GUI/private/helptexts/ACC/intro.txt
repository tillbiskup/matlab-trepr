INTRODUCTION

A rather short introduction to the ACC GUI


-=IF IN A HURRY=-

Given that you want to accumulate similar datasets and did not do any special things to them, the default settings should be fine. Select your datasets to accumulate, have a look at the proposed label for the accumulated data, hit "Apply", inspect your results (using the display settings), and if everything is as expected, "Close" the GUI and your accumulated data will be in the main GUI. If unhappy, "Discard" and try other settings, or "Discard" and "Close".

NOTE: The accumulated data gets written to the main GUI only when closing the ACC GUI (and only if you hit "Apply" before).


-=TO THE GENTLE READER=-

The accumulation (ACC) GUI is dedicated to the task of accumulating multiple datasets. Basically, it does not care about what data you want to accumulate, as long as they share at least a minimum amount of similar parameters and are of a format that the GUI recognises. It provides the user with the necessary controls to perform the accumulation itself. Whether it makes sense to perform the accumulation with the given set of data remains totally with the user.


GUI layout

Basically, the ACC GUI window is divided into five panels, two to the right of the main axis, and three below the main axis: the datasets panel, display panel, accumulation settings panel, interpolation method panel, and finally, the summary of results panel.

More details to all the different panels and the meaning of their control elements can be found in the respective help topic.


Normal operation

Normally, you simply go through the panels, first deciding about which datasets to accumulate, setting a label for the accumulated data, then checking the accumulation settings, the interpolation method, and then, after you have setup all things, you hit "Apply" to apply those parameters to the selected datasets and perform the actual accumulation.

After you did that, you will see the result in the main axis, where you can inspect it in the ususal way, as 2D or 1D plots, and for the latter at any position of the other axis, respectively. Of course, the latter only applies to the case where you have 2D data.

Additionally, you will find a summary of the performed action in the "Summary of results" panel.

If happy with the results, simply "Close" the GUI and your data will be written to the main GUI. If unhappy, hit "Discard" and either start a new round with different parameters or "Close" the GUI without writing back anything to the main GUI.


BTW: The button with the questionmark shows this help, as you might have figured out already.
