RESULTS SUMMARY

The summary of results panel will show a summary report of the accumulation performed, with all important and interesting parameters necessary to make a sound decision whether to go for the current accumulation results or to change parameters and try again or simply to discard the results and return to the GUI.

Details of what gets included into the report will follow soon.
