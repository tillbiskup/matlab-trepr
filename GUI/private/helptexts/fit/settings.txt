SETTINGS

The settings panel allows you to control both the behaviour of the fit function and the appearance of many of the elements in the main axis.


Fit parameters

Sometimes, the quality (and even overall success) depends on the parameters set for the fit routine used. This table gives you both an overview of the parameters that can be set (via Matlab "optimset" function) and their current values.

Especially the maximum number of function evaluations ("MaxFunEvals") and iterations ("MaxIter") and the tolerance ("TolX", "TolFun") are of interest.

If this GUI once gets upgraded so that it gives access as well to the functions provided by the "Matlab Optimization Toolbox", this table will provide you with full access to the parameters you can set for those functions as well.


Grid

Whether or not to display a grid in one or both directions, display a minor grid, and whether to show a line at zero.


Fit area

This lets you change the appearance (colour and transparency) of the fit areas.

The colour is displayed and can be set nearly arbitrarily by pressing "Palette". The "Alpha" value is the measure of transparency. It can be changed both with the slider or by directly entering a value in the edit field. Beware that valid values are between 0 (clear) and 1 (opaque).


Reference lines

For the reference lines, you can set the colour (via the "Palette" button) and both width and line style. 


Save

Later on, there will be the possibility to save the (changed) settings to a configuration file.


Defaults

To reset all settings to their default values, press this button. Note: There is no way to "undo" this.
