REPORT

The report panel displays a summary report of the fit performed, with all important and interesting parameters necessary to make a sound decision about the quality of the fit.

Details of what will be included in the report will be added later on, as soon as that has been decided about.

The report can be saved to a text file via the "Save" button in the "Fit" panel.
