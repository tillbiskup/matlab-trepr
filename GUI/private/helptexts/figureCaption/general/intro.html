		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			A rather short introduction to the Figure Caption GUI.
		</p>
		<div class="hurry">
		<h2>If in a hurry</h2>
		<p>
			Suppose you are about to save a figure you just created within the toolbox. It is always helpful to have a few notes recording what you did, what you wanted to show and why. In short: a (preliminary) figure caption. This window helps you writing one &mdash; and collects all information about the currently displayed datasets known to the toolbox.
		</p>
		</div>
		<h2>To the gentle reader</h2>
		<p>
			The Figure Caption GUI is dedicated to writing (at least preliminary) figure captions for the figure you're about to save. At the same time, it collects a wealth of information about the datasets displayed, as known to the toolbox. This should allow you to get a fair idea even after longer time what you plotted and why.
		</p>
		<p>
			The idea is to save a text file with the same file basename as the figure together with the figure file in the same place. This file contains both, the caption written by the user (and typed into the upper edit panel) and a wealth of information about the displayed data collected automatically by the toolbox.
		</p>
		<h3>GUI layout</h3>
		<p>
			The Figure Caption GUI window should be fairly intuitive and simple to use. It is divided basically into three parts: The caption edit panel on the top, followed by a (read-only) display of the data the toolbox collected about the datasets displayed, and at the bottom a display of the file basename currently used for saving both figure and the caption text.
		</p>
		<p>
			More details to the different panels can be found in the respective help topic:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="../controls/caption.html">Caption</a></li>
			<li><a href="../controls/information.html">Information</a></li>
			<li><a href="../controls/filename.html">Filename</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			What follows is a sketch of the typical operation of this GUI.
		</p>
		<p>
			BTW: The button with the questionmark shows this help, as you might have figured out already.
		</p>
		<h3>Normal operation</h3>
		<p>
			To make it as easy as possible for the user (as nobody wants to write much text while saving figures), immediately after opening this window, the edit panel for typing in the (preliminary) figure caption has the focus. That means that you can immediately start with writing. Once done with that, simply click on the <key>Save</key> button in the bottom right to save your caption and information as an ASCII file together with the figure file.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you decide not to save a caption and discard all that information, simply hit <key>Esc</key> or click on the <key>Discard</key> button. If you already started typing some text in the caption panel, you will get asked whether you want to save that text.
		</p>
		<p>
			To close the Figure Caption GUI, simply hit the <key>Save</key> or <key>Discard</key> buttons on the bottom right, depening on whether you want to save or discard your caption text. This will bring you back to the main GUI. Alternatively, you may press <key>Esc</key> or <key>Ctrl+w</key>.
