		<h1>Information for datasets displayed</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			There is a wealth of information known to the toolbox for each dataset displayed. To help the user keeping track of the datasets displayed in a figure, this information is collected and displayed in the "Information" panel as well as appended to the caption file.
		</p>
		<h2>What get's displayed</h2>
		<p>
			The information block starts with an overview of the number of datasets, followed by a block for each dataset.
		</p>
		<p>
			As there is no need to edit this information, the respective panel is set to read-only. This is indicated consistently throughout the toolbox via the grey rather than white background.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, the information displayed is the same as if one would create an info file for the respective dataset. In the future, both, history records and display options will be added as well.
