		<h1>Figure Caption</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			The "Figure Caption" panel is the key panel of the Figure Caption GUI. Here the user enters the caption text corresponding to the saved figure. As it has the focus when the GUI is opened, one can directly start typing the caption.
		</p>
		<h2>Minimal requirements</h2>
		<p>
			Technically speaking, the user doesn't need to add any text to this window. Even if there is no caption text, the text file written will (normally) contain information about the datasets currently displayed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nevertheless, at least one line shortly describing the purpose of the figure seems sensible.
		</p>
		<h2>Writing useful figure captions</h2>
		<p>
			There is many different ways of writing figure captions. A useful figure caption nevertheless contains a minimum of information, and ideally, a figure together with its caption can be understood on its own, without additional information needed.
		</p>
		<p>
			What has proven useful is to start a figure caption with a single sentence, something of a title for the whole thing. This can often be printed boldface in a real caption in a document, and it helps the reader to catch the idea of the figure.
		</p>
		<p>
			Documenting the purpose of the figure might be sensible as well. Whereas the "hard facts" about the datasets will be collected directly from the toolbox (as far as the toolbox is aware of them), the reason for plotting the figure is not known to the toolbox and therefore has to be added by the user.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ideally, the caption as saved to the text file can directly be used when writing documents including the figure (such as articles, theses, or a documentation in a Wiki as sort of an electronic lab book).
