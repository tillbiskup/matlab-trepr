		<h1>Filename</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			The filename displayed here normally corresponds to the filename of the saved figure. Nevertheless, there might be reasons to change that.
		</p>
		<h2>Changing the filename</h2>
		<p>
			Changing the filename for the text file containing the caption and additional information about the datasets displayed is quite easy: Just click on the <key>Change</key> button on the right of the "Filename" panel. This will open a file selection dialogue box letting the user choose an alternative filename.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Please note:</strong> Currently, there is no easy way to change both the figure and the caption filename at once. Therefore, it is highly recommended not to change the preset filename of the caption file - except you know exactly what you do and have very good reason to do so.
		</p>
		<h2>General remarks</h2>
		<p>
			In general, the filename will share the file basename with the figure file. As extension, "txt" is used to indicate that it is an ASCII file.
