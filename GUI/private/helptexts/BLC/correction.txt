CORRECTION

The correction panel lets you specify the correction methods, preview the results, and shows a summary of the performed action.


Correction method

Currently, only three out of the four different correction methods available are working. The subtraction of a fitted baseline does not yet work.

The different methods in more detail:

* First n time traces

Average over the first n time traces and subtract this average from every time trace. Equivalent to subtraction of a polynomial of 0th order.


* Last m time traces

Average over the last m time traces and subtract this average from every time trace. Equivalent to subtraction of a polynomial of 0th order.


* Weighted average of first/last

Equivalent to subtraction of a polynomial of 1st order.


* Subtract fitted baseline

This method currently does not work. The idea is to fit a nonlinear baseline to the end of the spectrum (as displayed at the bottom left) and subtract that baseline from each spectrum at each point in time.



Fit function

Only active if "Subtract fitted baseline" was chosen as method. Currently not functional.
