		<h1>Correction</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			The correction panel lets you specify the correction methods, preview the results, and shows a summary of the performed action.
		</p>
		<h2>Correction method</h2>
		<p>
			Currently, only three out of the four different correction methods available are working. The subtraction of a fitted baseline does not yet work.
		</p>
		<p>
			The different methods in more detail:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>First n time traces</dt>
			<dd>Average over the first n time traces and subtract this average from every time trace. Equivalent to subtraction of a polynomial of 0th order.</dd>
			<dt>Last m time traces</dt>
			<dd>Average over the last m time traces and subtract this average from every time trace. Equivalent to subtraction of a polynomial of 0th order.</dd>
			<dt>Weighted average of first/last</dt>
			<dd>Equivalent to subtraction of a polynomial of 1st order.</dd>
			<dt>Subtract fitted baseline</dt>
			<dd>This method currently does not work. The idea is to fit a nonlinear baseline to the end of the spectrum (as displayed at the bottom left) and subtract that baseline from each spectrum at each point in time.</dd>
		</dl>
		<h2>Fit function</h2>
		<p>
			Only active if "Subtract fitted baseline" was chosen as method. Currently not functional.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>
			Textual summary of the correction performed.
