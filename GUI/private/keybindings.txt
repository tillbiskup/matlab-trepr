There are a couple of key bindings that may make life easier when working with this GUI.

PLEASE NOTE: Currently, the key bindings do work only if you have not selected any of the elements.*


SWITCHING BETWEEN PANELS

Ctrl-1 ... Ctrl-9

(Mac: Ctrl or Command)



FUNCTION KEYS (F1...F12)

F1 - "Help:About" window

F2 - "Status" window



CLOSING THE GUI

Ctrl-w

(Mac: Ctrl or Command)





* MATLAB(TM) programmers will immediately know why... (keypressfcn only defined for main figure)
