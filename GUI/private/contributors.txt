This toolbox and especially the GUI
would not have been possible without many people
contributing by some means or other.


A very special thanks for their outstanding support
and encouragement goes to:

Stefan Weber
&
Erik Schleicher



Several people - besides the two mentioned above -
contributed ideas, helped with tips&tricks, ...



- The former "Berlin crew" -
(where everything originated)


Martin Hussels

Ringo Wenzel
(with his 'cw_ana' toolbox)

Julia Löwenstein


***


- The Freiburg People -


Bernd Paulus

Thomas Berthold


...and all students debugging the software and encouraging me to continue...

I apologise for the incompleteness of this list.
If somebody thinks that he or she should be added,
please send me an email.

Besides that, I learned a great deal from other people
that did and do a lot more work with MATLAB.

Parts of the code are based heavily on code written by
other people. Where this is the case, I tried to mention
it directly in the respective files.

Nevertheless, to mention the most important
sources of inspiration:


The Matlab(TM) documentation and examples
(c) The MathWorks, Inc.


The people from blinkdagger

Thanks for your patience with all the bugs and the incompleteness of this piece of software.
