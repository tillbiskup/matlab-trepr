   <title>trEPR Toolbox : Getting Started</title>
  </head>
  <body>
	  
	<h1>Getting Started</h1>

	  <p>
	  	Introduces the toolbox and describes the types of problems it is designed to solve.
	  </p>

	<h2 id="whatis">What is the trEPR Toolbox?</h2>
	  
	  <p>
	  	The trEPR Toolbox is a collection of <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/" title="MATLAB(TM) Homepage">MATLAB<sup>&reg;</sup></a> scripts for the analysis of <a href="http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~biskup/forschung/epr/trEPR" title="WWW link">transient EPR data</a> recorded with the program <a href="http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~toerring/fsc2.phtml" title="Homepage of the fsc2 program">fsc2</a>. Most of the functions are independent of the recording format (data file recorded with fsc2).
	  </p>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>

    	  <p>
	  	Typically, transient EPR spectra are measured as 2D data sets in the time and field domain. At each point of the field axis a single 1D spectrum over time is recorded (called time trace or time slice). Several of these time slices at different points on the field axis form the complete 2D data set.
	  </p>

    	  <p>
	  	Both dimensions (field domain and time domain) are of interest for the analysis of the data. Therefore, the trEPR Toolbox provides functions to get slices from the 2D data set as well in field direction as in time direction.
	  </p>

	<h3>Functions</h3>

    	  <p>
	  	For a direct acces there is the <a href="funcsalphabet.html">alphabetic index of the functions</a>. Especially for users new to this toolbox the <a href="funcsoverview.html">overview of the functions</a> grouped by categories may be useful.
	  </p>

	<h3>User Interface</h3>

    	  <p>
	  	Currently, most of the functions provided by the trEPR toolbox are designed to be used at the command line. Some of them do their job in an interactive manner asking the user questions, others are more or less quiet.
	  </p>

    	  <p>
        One exception is the <code>GUI_fsc2_display</code> function that provides a graphical users interface (GUI) similar to that of the <a href="http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~toerring/fsc2.phtml" title="Homepage of the fsc2 program">fsc2</a> program used mainly for recording the transient spectra.
