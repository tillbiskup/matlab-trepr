	<h1>trEPR Toolbox - overview of the functions</h1>

	  <p>
	  	If you are looking for the documentation of a function directly and you know its name, the <a href="funcsalphabet.html">alphabetic index of the functions</a> may be a better place.
	  </p>

	  <h2>general functions</h2>

	  <p>
		All functions summed here are not specific for the trEPR-toolbox, but are used by it. They are functions for handling and manipulating filenames and strings and for logging purposes.

	  <h2>file-specific functions</h2>

	  <p>
		File-specific functions are either functions to read fsc2-data directly or to write and read ASCII data, including some important parameters, as frequently used inside the trEPR toolbox.

	  <h2>functions for data processing</h2>

	  <p>
		The functions for data processing are the main part of the trEPR toolbox. They can be divided by their applicability to 2D and solely to 1D data, whereas the functions that are capable to handle 2D data can handle 1D data as well.

	  <h2>interactive programs</h2>

	  <p>
	  	The interactive programs cover complete data analysis tasks. They make use of most or all of the functions implemented in the toolbox and can be used as templates to develop own programs for special tasks.
