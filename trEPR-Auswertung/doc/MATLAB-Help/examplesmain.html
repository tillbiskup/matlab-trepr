   <title>trEPR Toolbox - examples</title>

	<h1>Examples</h1>
	  
	<p>
	  Here will come a collection of examples for the use of the trEPR Toolbox, divided into several categories. They are an excellent starting point for writing your own code. 
	</p>
      
    <h2>2D datasets</h2>
      
    <p>
      The spectra recorded with transient EPR consist of a set of transients (<a href="examples/timeSlices.html">time slices</a>) recorded at a fixed field position and showing the development of the signal in time. This set of time slices forms a <a href="examples/2DDatasets.html">2D dataset</a>.

    <h2>B<sub>0</sub> spectra</h2>
      
    <p>
      The spectra recorded with transient EPR consist of a set of transients (<a href="examples/timeSlices.html">time slices</a>) recorded at a fixed field position and showing the development of the signal in time. Slices parallel to the B<sub>0</sub> axis at distinct position in time lead to <a href="examples/B0Spectra.html">B<sub>0</sub> spectra</a>.

    <h2>Time Slices</h2>
      
    <p>
      The spectra recorded with transient EPR consist of a set of transients (<a href="examples/timeSlices.html">time slices</a>) recorded at a fixed field position and showing the development of the signal in time.

    <h3>Overview of the Time Slices at Different Field Positions</h3>
        
	<p>
	  Given that you have measured time slices at distinct field positions and want to create a <a href="examples/timeSlicesOverviewFigure.html">figure giving an overview of all these time slices</a>.
	</p>
	
    <h3>B<sub>1</sub>-Dependence of the Kinetics</h3>
        
	<p>
	  Given that you have measured time slices at the signal maximum at different MW power (B<sub>1</sub>) and want to create a <a href="examples/timeSlicesB1Dependence.html">figure showing the B<sub>1</sub>-dependence</a> of the kinetics.
