CHANGES WITHOUT PREVIOUS WARNING AND MAY CONTAIN ANY SORT OF ERROR.

1.) read_fsc2_data.m

If run with MATLAB(R), the file "read_fsc2_data.m" needs the two files (routines)
"index.m" and "substr.m" for proper function.

These two files are workarounds to implement functions from GNU Octave in MATLAB(R).
